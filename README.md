# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using PyTorch

Welcome to the repository for the **CNN Tutorial** using PyTorch. This repository is designed to guide participants through the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), building models with PyTorch, and applying them to real-world data.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into the following sections:

- **Prerequisites**: Resources for getting used to Python and Google Colab.
- **Demos**: Step-by-step instructions and content for the five sessions.
- **Exercises**: Practical assignments to be completed during the session to reinforce the concepts learned in the demos.
- **Solutions**: Solutions for all the above Practical assignments.

## Prerequisites

Detailed instructions can be found in the [prerequisite folder](./0%20Prerequisites/)
