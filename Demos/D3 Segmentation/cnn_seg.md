## Introduction to Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, each corresponding to a different object or part of the image. In this tutorial, we'll use a CNN to perform semantic segmentation on drone imagery, where each pixel is classified into one of several predefined categories.

## Visualizing Raw Data and Masks

Before we start processing the data, it's important to visualize the raw images and their corresponding segmentation masks. This helps us understand the nature of our data and the task at hand.

## Creating Data Loaders

Data loaders are essential components in PyTorch for efficiently loading and batching our data during training. They help in managing the data flow and can handle tasks such as shuffling, batching, and parallel data loading.

In our project, we use the `get_data_loaders` function from the `cnn_data` module to create our data loaders. Here's how we do it:

## Data Processing and Augmentation

Data processing and augmentation are crucial steps in preparing our dataset for training. These techniques help to increase the diversity of our training data, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In our project, we use the `albumentations` library for image augmentation. Here's an example of how we set up our augmentation pipeline:
