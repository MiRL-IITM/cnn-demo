# Prerequisite: Python Programming

Before starting this tutorial on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it's important that you have a good understanding of Python programming. This will help you follow along with the coding exercises and make the most out of these tutorials.

## Why Python?

In all of the following tutorials, we will be using Pytorch. PyTorch is a Python-based deep learning framework, and most machine learning tools and libraries are built using Python. You will be writing Python code throughout this tutorial to implement CNNs, so having a foundational knowledge of Python is essential.

### Key Concepts to Know

To fully benefit from this tutorial, you should be comfortable with the following Python concepts:

- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Functions and Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods)
- Basic file handling
- Using third-party libraries (like `numpy`, `matplotlib`)

## Self-Test: Are You Ready?

To help you gauge your readiness, here are a few questions and coding tasks. Try solving them, and if you can complete them confidently, you're ready to proceed.

1. **Basic Python Functions:**
   Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the list in reverse order.

   ```python
   def reverse_list(numbers):
       # Your code here
   ```

   Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum and average.

   ```python
   def calculate_stats(numbers):
       # Your code here
   ```

2. **File Handling:**
   Write Python code to read a file line by line and print each line.

   ```python
   def read_file(file_path):
       # Your code here
   ```

3. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   Create a class `Animal` with an attribute `name` and a method `speak()` that prints a message.

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def __init__(self, name):
           # Your code here
   ```

4. **Using Libraries:**
   Import `numpy` and create a 2x3 matrix of ones.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   # Your code here
   ```

5. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib:**
   Plot a simple line graph using `matplotlib`. The graph should show the relationship between two lists: `x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`. Label the axes and give the plot a title.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Data
   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

   # Your code here
   ```

If you are unfamiliar with or struggling with any of these tasks, it is recommended that you spend time strengthening your Python skills before proceeding.
