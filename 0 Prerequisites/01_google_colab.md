# Prerequisite: Google Colab

We will be using **Google Colab** as the environment for writing and running PyTorch code. Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook service that allows you to execute code in a web browser without the need for local installation.

- **Create a Google account:** If you donâ€™t already have one, create a free [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).
- **Access Google Colab:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

If you've got no experience with it, please go through the free [Introduction to Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) (though you can pick this up as we go along)
